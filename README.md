# Using RS232 on Spartan 6 FPGA Papilio-type dev boards

rs232_rx_demo is based on the [Gadget Factory](http://www.gadgetfactory.net/) tutorial ["The quickest way to implement PC-to-FPGA communication using a Papilio FPGA board"](http://gadgetfactory.net/learn/2013/12/02/the-quickest-way-to-implement-pc-to-fpga-communication-using-a-papilio-fpga-board/)

**This doesn't work yet - refactoring and typo correction is in progress**
